# ProtEvol

## Set of R scripts to analyse output of ScanTools_ProtEvol

### To search for selection on protein-sequence level 
Used for detection of selection acting on meiosis protein sequence in diploid and tetraploid A. arenosa; Bohutinska et al., 2021: De-novo mutation and rapid protein (co-)evolution during meiotic adaptation in Arabidopsis arenosa, MBE

protScanTools.r 

### To identify signatures of parallel selection across multiple population pairs
Used to search for mechanisms of parallel adaptation in multiple foothill-alpine population pairs of A. arenosa and A. halleri; Bohutinska et al., unpubl.: Genomic basis of parallel adaptation varies with divergence in Arabidopsis and its relatives (https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.24.005397)
